========
> This is a joke crate! Don't take this seriously! And don't use in production. (Unless you are the ultimate furry.)

> Warning! This crate uses some strong language, and one or two sexual words. The point of these is not to invoke thoughts of sexual activity, but to exagerate the ridioculousness of the "furry" language for entertainment purposes.

Intwoducing teh OwO Code wanguage owo! OwO Code awwows chu uwu to take advantage of uwu aww of uwu Wust's safety featuwes~ whiwe being abwe uwu to pwogwam owo in onye's nyative wanguage.
